### Topics
<br>
Upon initial login, PADAS Manager checks whether all required topics are created and available.  If any one of the required topics is missing, you'll be redirected to Topics view in order to view and update existing settings. This is a simple interface to create required Kafka topics through PADAS Manager interface.

**Important Note**: Number of partitions can NOT be changed/updated once a topic is created.  This value depends on your data volume and scalability requirements.  If you need to change/update this value for any reason, the topic will need to be deleted and created again with new values.  For more information regarding topics, please refer to [Topic Properties](/docs/admin-guide.html#anchor3)

If you need more control over topic creation, please consult your Kafka/PADAS administrator; you can also refer to [Confluent Documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/control-center/topics/overview.html).

### Properties
<br>
Properties view provides configuration entries for Detect and Transform Engine components.  You can click <span class="btn btn-padas">Edit</span> button to enter in edit mode and make changes.  Following table provides information on the form fields.

**NOTE**: You can upload (click <span class="btn btn-padas"><i class="bi bi-chevron-right"></i> Upload Properties from File</span> button) and/or download (click <span class="btn btn-padas"><i class="bi bi-download"></i> Download Properties </span> button) properties as a file.  A sample properties file for Winlogbeat transformations can be found here: [Winlogbeat Sysmon and Security](/assets/config/padas_transformation.properties)

**NOTE**: You can click <span class="btn btn-padas"><i class="bi bi-plus-lg"></i> Add New Transformation</span> button to add new input topics for analysis.  The input topic *must* exist prior to starting PADAS Transform Engine.

**NOTE**: After any configuration changes, you will need to restart the corresponding component(s) (i.e. Detect and/or Transform Engine(s)).  PADAS instances read and load the configuration upon starting.
